## 🥓 RECIPE P-001: Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin

**Category:** Pork | **Type:** Premium  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Servings:** 4-6

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
- **Marination Time:** 30 minutes (vacuum) or 4 hours (traditional)
- **Cook Time:** 25-30 minutes
- **Total Time:** 55 minutes (with vacuum marination)
- **Storage Duration:** Frozen 12-18 months, Refrigerated marinated 3-4 days

### Why This Meal is Special

Vacuum sealing forces the herb marinade deep into the lean tenderloin while the bacon wrapping creates a protective fat layer during freezing. The result is incredibly juicy meat with zero freezer burn, even after a year of storage. The vacuum process also allows you to pre-wrap with bacon and freeze, making this a grab-and-cook meal.

### Ingredients

**For the Tenderloin:**

- 2 pork tenderloins (800g / 1.75 lbs total)
- 12-16 strips streaky bacon (400g / 14 oz)
- 3 tbsp Dijon mustard (45ml)
- 2 tbsp olive oil (30ml)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced (Safety: Use 1 tsp powder or roasted garlic for long storage)
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped (10g / 0.35 oz)
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped (5g / 0.2 oz)
- 1 tsp black pepper (5g)
- 1 tsp salt (5g)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Rosemary/Thyme (Dominant):** Herbaceous crust
- **Garlic/Mustard (Supporting):** Sharp/Savoury
- **Bacon (Fat/Salt):** Smoky wrapper

**Optional Glaze:**

- 2 tbsp honey (30ml)
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar (15ml)

### Equipment

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (gallon size)
- Roasting pan or baking sheet
- Meat thermometer
- Kitchen twine (optional)

### Instructions

**Preparation:**

1. Pat pork tenderloins completely dry with paper towels. Remove any silver skin with a sharp knife.
2. In a small bowl, combine Dijon mustard, olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, black pepper, and salt to create a paste.
3. Rub the herb paste evenly over all sides of both tenderloins, ensuring full coverage.

**Vacuum Marination:**
4. Place one tenderloin into a vacuum sealer bag. Seal on **gentle/delicate setting** (pulse mode if available) to avoid crushing the meat.
5. Repeat with second tenderloin.
6. Refrigerate for 30 minutes minimum. The vacuum pressure will force the herbs and garlic deep into the meat fibers.

**Bacon Wrapping:**
7. Remove tenderloins from bags (save marinade). Pat surface slightly dry.
8. Lay 6-8 bacon strips overlapping on a cutting board.
9. Place tenderloin at one end and roll tightly, wrapping bacon around the meat. The bacon should overlap and cover the entire surface.
10. Optional: Secure with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals.

**For Immediate Cooking:**
11. Preheat oven to 200Â°C (400Â°F).
12. Place bacon-wrapped tenderloins seam-side down on a roasting pan.
13. Optional: Brush with honey-balsamic glaze.
14. Roast for 25-30 minutes until internal temperature reaches 63Â°C (145Â°F).
15. Rest for 5 minutes, then slice into medallions.

**For Freezing:**
11. Place each bacon-wrapped tenderloin into a fresh vacuum sealer bag.
12. Vacuum seal on **gentle setting**.
13. Freeze flat for optimal storage and quick thawing.

**Cooking from Frozen:**

- Thaw in refrigerator for 12-24 hours.
- Follow roasting instructions above, adding 5 minutes to cook time if still slightly frozen.

### Storage

- **Frozen (vacuum sealed):** 12-18 months
- **Refrigerated (marinated, unwrapped):** 3-4 days
- **Refrigerated (cooked):** 4-5 days

### Pro Tips

**Vacuum Advantage:**

- The vacuum forces garlic and herbs INTO the meat, not just on the surface. You'll taste rosemary in every bite, not just the crust.
- Bacon fat prevents freezer burn by creating an airtight seal around the lean tenderloin.
- Pre-wrapping with bacon saves 15 minutes on busy weeknightsâ€”just thaw and roast.

**Cooking Tips:**

- Don't overcook! Pork is safe at 63Â°C (145Â°F) with a slight pink center. Overcooking makes it dry.
- Place bacon seam-side down first so it crisps and seals itself shut.
- For extra crispy bacon, broil for 2 minutes at the end.

**Variations:**

- **Apple-Sage Version:** Replace rosemary with fresh sage and brush with apple cider reduction.
- **Spicy Version:** Add 1 tsp chipotle powder to the herb paste.
- **Prosciutto Wrap:** Use prosciutto instead of bacon for a more delicate flavor.

## 🍖 RECIPE P-002: Asian Five-Spice Pork Belly

**Category:** Pork | **Type:** Premium  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Servings:** 6-8

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 15 minutes
- **Wet-Aging Time:** 3-7 days (refrigerated, vacuum sealed)
- **Cook Time:** 3 hours slow roast + 30 minutes crispy finish
- **Total Time:** 4-7 days (including aging)
- **Storage Duration:** Frozen 18-24 months, Refrigerated aged 7 days

### Why This Meal is Special

Wet-aging pork belly in a vacuum-sealed bag with Chinese five-spice creates an incredibly tender, restaurant-quality result. The vacuum environment allows enzymes to break down tough collagen while preventing oxidation. After aging, the pork crisps perfectly with a lacquered skin and melt-in-mouth fat layersâ€”impossible to achieve without the vacuum aging step.

### Ingredients

**For the Dry Rub:**

- 1.5 kg pork belly, skin-on (3.3 lbs)
- 3 tbsp Chinese five-spice powder (45g)
- 2 tbsp brown sugar (30g / 1 oz)
- 1 tbsp salt (15g)
- 1 tsp white pepper (5g)
- 1 tsp garlic powder (5g)
- 1 tsp ginger powder (5g)

**For the Glaze:**

- 3 tbsp soy sauce (45ml)
- 2 tbsp honey (30ml)
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar (15ml)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil (15ml)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (10g / 0.35 oz)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Five-Spice (Dominant):** 3 tbsp - Warm Anise/Cinnamon
- **Brown Sugar (Supporting):** Sweetness
- **Garlic/Ginger (Accent):** Aromatics

### Equipment

- Vacuum sealer
- Large vacuum sealer bags
- Roasting pan with rack
- Sharp knife (for scoring)
- Meat thermometer
- Brush for glazing

### Instructions

**Preparation & Aging:**

1. Score the pork belly skin in a crosshatch pattern, cutting through skin but not into meat (1cm/0.4 inch apart).
2. Combine all dry rub ingredients in a bowl.
3. Rub the spice mixture all over the pork belly, massaging into the scored skin and meat surfaces.
4. Place pork belly into a large vacuum sealer bag.
5. Vacuum seal on **normal setting** (pork belly is firm enough to handle pressure).

**Wet-Aging Process:**
6. Refrigerate for **minimum 3 days, optimal 7 days** at 1-4Â°C (34-39Â°F).
7. Flip the bag daily to ensure even aging.
8. **Food Science:** During this time, natural enzymes break down connective tissue while the vacuum prevents spoilage. The five-spice aroma infuses through all fat layers.

**Slow Roast (Day of Cooking):**
9. Remove pork from vacuum bag. Pat skin completely dry with paper towels (critical for crispy skin).
10. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 160Â°C (320Â°F).
12. Place pork belly skin-side up on a roasting rack.
13. Slow roast for 2.5-3 hours until meat is fork-tender (internal temp 88Â°C / 190Â°F).

**Crispy Finish:**
14. Increase oven temperature to 220Â°C (425Â°F).
15. Combine glaze ingredients and brush over the meat (not the skin).
16. Roast for 25-30 minutes until skin is deeply browned and crackling.
17. Watch carefully to prevent burning.

**Serving:**
18. Rest for 10 minutes, then slice into thick strips.
19. Serve immediately while skin is crispy.

### Storage

- **Frozen (raw, vacuum sealed):** 18-24 months
- **Refrigerated (wet-aging):** 7 days maximum
- **Refrigerated (cooked):** 5 days
- **Frozen (cooked, vacuum sealed):** 6-8 months

### Pro Tips

**Vacuum Advantage:**

- Wet-aging in vacuum creates enzyme activity without oxygen = tender meat, no spoilage.
- The five-spice deeply penetrates all fat layers, creating consistent flavor throughout.
- You can age for up to 7 days safely (impossible without vacuum sealing).

**Cooking Tips:**

- **Critical:** Skin must be bone dry before final roasting for crackling to form.
- If skin isn't crisping, increase heat to 240Â°C (465Â°F) and watch closely.
- Don't skip the slow roastâ€”this is what makes the fat tender and gelatinous.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Slice into strips and serve with steamed buns (gua bao).
- Dice and add to fried rice or ramen.
- Serve with pickled vegetables to cut the richness.

**Variations:**

- **Korean Version:** Use gochugaru (chili flakes) + gochujang in the glaze.
- **Thai Version:** Add lemongrass and galangal to the rub.

- 1 tbsp olive oil (15ml)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (10g / 0.35 oz)
- 1 tsp fresh thyme, chopped (or 1/2 tsp dried) (2g)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper (2.5g)
- 1/4 tsp salt (1.25g)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Maple (Dominant):** Sweet Caramel
- **Mustard (Supporting):** Tangy contrast
- **Thyme (Accent):** Earthy note

**For Searing:**

- 1 tbsp butter (15g)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil (15ml)

### Equipment

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (gallon size)
- Cast iron skillet or heavy pan

### Instructions

**Preparation:**

1. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels.
2. If chops have thick fat cap, score it in 3-4 places (prevents curling).

**Marinade:**
3. In a bowl, whisk together maple syrup, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, thyme, pepper, and salt.

**Vacuum Marination:**
4. Place pork chops into a vacuum sealer bag in a single layer (use 2 bags if needed).
5. Pour marinade over chops, ensuring even coating.
6. Vacuum seal on **gentle setting** (pulse mode to prevent liquid extraction).
7. Refrigerate for **20 minutes minimum**. The vacuum will force the marinade into the meat, creating juiciness throughout.

**Cooking:**
8. Remove chops from bag, letting excess marinade drip off (reserve marinade).
9. Pat chops dry with paper towel (for better sear).
10. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
11. Heat cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter and vegetable oil.
12. Once butter foams, add pork chops. Sear for 4-5 minutes without moving.
13. Flip and sear other side for 4-5 minutes until internal temperature reaches 63Â°C (145Â°F).
14. In final minute, spoon reserved marinade over chops (it will caramelize in the hot pan).
15. Remove from heat and rest for 5 minutes.

**For Freezing (Raw Marinated):**
8. After marination, freeze chops in the sealed bag.
9. To cook from frozen: Thaw in refrigerator 12-24 hours, then follow cooking instructions above.

### Storage

- **Frozen (raw marinated, vacuum sealed):** 12-18 months
- **Refrigerated (marinated raw):** 3 days

- No dry, bland centerâ€”every bite is evenly flavored and juicy.

**Cooking Tips:**

- **Don't overcook!** Pork is safe at 63Â°C (145Â°F) with slight pink. It will reach 65Â°C during rest.
- For perfect sear, make sure pan is HOT and chops are DRY before adding.
- If chops are browning too fast, reduce heat to medium.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Mashed sweet potatoes and green beans
- Apple slaw and roasted Brussels sprouts
- Garlic butter pasta
- Quinoa and roasted root vegetables

**Variations:**

- **Apple-Maple:** Add 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar to marinade, serve with sautÃ©ed apples.

### Why This Meal is Special

Vacuum-sealing lemon-oregano marinade into pork creates authentic Greek souvlaki flavor in 30 minutes instead of overnight. The acid from lemon and yogurt breaks down proteins rapidly under vacuum pressure, resulting in tender, juicy skewers with deep Mediterranean flavor. These can be frozen on skewers and grilled directly from frozenâ€”perfect for quick summer meals.

### Ingredients

**For the Marinade:**

- 1 kg pork tenderloin or pork shoulder, cut into 3cm cubes (2.2 lbs)
- 120ml Greek yogurt (1/2 cup)
- 60ml olive oil (1/4 cup)
- 2 lemons, juiced (80ml / 1/3 cup)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced (20g / 0.7 oz)
- 2 tbsp dried oregano (30g)
- 1 tsp paprika (5g)
- 1 tsp salt (5g)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper (2.5g)
- 1/2 tsp cumin (2.5g)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Oregano/Lemon (Dominant):** Greek classic
- **Garlic (Supporting):** Pungent bulb
- **Yogurt (Carrier):** Tenderizing acid

**For Skewers:**

- Wooden or metal skewers
- 2 red onions, cut into chunks (300g / 10.5 oz)
- 2 bell peppers, cut into 3cm squares (300g / 10.5 oz)

### Equipment

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (gallon size)
- 12 skewers (soak wooden skewers in water for 30 min)
- Grill, grill pan, or broiler
- Tongs

### Instructions

**Preparation:**

1. Cut pork into 3cm (1.2 inch) cubesâ€”uniform size ensures even cooking.
2. In a bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper, and cumin.

**Vacuum Marination:**
3. Place pork cubes into a vacuum sealer bag.
4. Pour marinade over pork, ensuring all pieces are coated.
5. Vacuum seal on **gentle setting** (pulse mode).
6. Massage bag to distribute marinade evenly.
7. Refrigerate for **30 minutes minimum**. The lemon acid + vacuum pressure will tenderize the pork rapidly.

**Skewering:**
8. Remove pork from vacuum bag (discard marinadeâ€”it contains raw meat juice).
9. Thread pork onto skewers, alternating with onion chunks and bell pepper squares.
10. Leave small gaps between pieces for even cooking.

**Grilling:**
11. Preheat grill to medium-high heat (or broiler).
12. Oil the grill grates.
13. Grill skewers for 10-12 minutes, turning every 3 minutes, until pork reaches 63Â°C (145Â°F) internal temp.
14. Pork should have nice char marks but remain juicy inside.

**Serving:**
15. Rest for 2-3 minutes.
16. Serve with pita bread, tzatziki sauce, and Greek salad.

**For Freezing (Pre-Skewered):**
8. After skewering raw marinated pork, place skewers on a parchment-lined tray.
9. Flash-freeze for 2 hours until solid.
10. Transfer frozen skewers to vacuum sealer bags (or wrap tightly in plastic wrap then vacuum seal).
11. Freeze flat.
12. To cook from frozen: Grill directly from frozen, adding 5-7 minutes to cook time.

**For Freezing (Cooked):**
13. Cool grilled skewers completely.
14. Vacuum seal in portions.
15. Reheat in oven at 180Â°C (350Â°F) for 10-12 minutes.

## 🍖 RECIPE P-008: Italian Porchetta Roast

**Category:** Pork | **Type:** Premium  
**Difficulty:** Advanced  
**Servings:** 8-10

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 30 minutes
- **Dry Brining Time:** 24 hours (refrigerated)
- **Wet-Aging Time:** 3-7 days (optional, for enhanced tenderness)
- **Cook Time:** 3-4 hours
- **Total Time:** 1-7 days (depending on aging)
- **Storage Duration:** Frozen raw 18-24 months, Cooked 12 months

### Why This Meal is Special

Vacuum-sealing porchetta after dry brining and before wet-aging creates an intensely flavored, melt-in-mouth roast that rivals Italian delis. The vacuum environment allows the herb paste to penetrate deep into the rolled pork belly while collagen breaks down during aging. This is the ultimate make-ahead feastâ€”prep a week early, vacuum seal, age in the fridge, then roast for a showstopper meal.

### Ingredients

**For the Pork:**

- 2.5 kg pork belly, boneless, skin-on (5.5 lbs)
- 500g pork loin, trimmed (1.1 lbs) - optional for leaner center
- 2 tbsp coarse sea salt (30g)

**For the Herb Paste:**

- 8 cloves garlic, minced (Safety: Use roasted garlic paste for safer aging, or keep fridge &lt;3Â°C and cook to 190Â°F)
- 4 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped (20g / 0.7 oz)
- 3 tbsp fresh sage, finely chopped (15g / 0.5 oz)
- 2 tbsp fennel seeds, toasted and crushed (30g)
- 2 tbsp lemon zest (from 2 lemons) (12g)
- 1 tbsp black pepper, coarsely ground (15g)
- 1 tsp chili flakes (5g) - optional
- 60ml olive oil (1/4 cup)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Fennel/Rosemary (Dominant):** Italian Roast Profile
- **Garlic/Lemon (Supporting):** Bright Aromatic
- **Sage/Chili (Accent):** Warmth

### Equipment

- Vacuum sealer
- Large vacuum sealer bags
- Sharp knife for scoring
- Kitchen twine
- Roasting pan with rack
- Meat thermometer

### Instructions

**Day 1 - Preparation & Dry Brining:**

1. Lay pork belly skin-side down on cutting board. Score the meat side in a crosshatch pattern (don't cut through).
2. If using pork loin, place it lengthwise in the center of the belly.
3. Sprinkle 2 tbsp coarse salt evenly over the meat side.
4. Wrap loosely in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 24 hours (dry brine tenderizes and seasons).

**Day 2 - Herb Paste & Rolling:**
5. Toast fennel seeds in a dry pan for 2 minutes until fragrant. Crush with mortar and pestle.
6. Combine crushed fennel, garlic, rosemary, sage, lemon zest, black pepper, chili flakes, and olive oil into a thick paste.
7. Remove pork from refrigerator. Pat meat side dry (leave skin dry too).
8. Spread herb paste evenly over the meat side, pressing into the score marks.
9. Roll the pork belly tightly from one short end to the other (like a Swiss roll), keeping skin on the outside.
10. Tie with kitchen twine at 3cm (1 inch) intervalsâ€”tie TIGHTLY to prevent unrolling.

**Vacuum Wet-Aging (Optional but Recommended):**
11. Place rolled, tied porchetta into a large vacuum sealer bag.
12. Vacuum seal on **normal setting** (it's firm enough to handle pressure).
13. Refrigerate for **3-7 days** at 1-4Â°C (34-39Â°F).
14. **Food Science:** Natural enzymes break down collagen, making the meat ultra-tender while vacuum prevents spoilage.

**Day of Cooking:**
15. Remove porchetta from vacuum bag 1 hour before cooking (bring to room temperature).
16. Pat skin completely DRY (critical for crackling).
17. Score the skin in parallel lines, 1cm (0.4 inch) apart, cutting through skin but not meat.
18. Rub skin with 1 tsp salt.

**Roasting:**
19. Preheat oven to 160Â°C (320Â°F).
20. Place porchetta on a roasting rack, skin-side up.
21. Slow roast for 3-3.5 hours until internal temperature reaches 88Â°C (190Â°F).
22. Increase oven to 240Â°C (465Â°F).
23. Roast for 20-30 minutes until skin crackles and turns golden brown. Watch closelyâ€”skin can burn quickly.

**Resting & Serving:**
24. Rest for 15-20 minutes.
25. Remove twine. Slice into 1-2 cm thick rounds, ensuring each slice has crackling.

**For Freezing (Raw, Rolled):**

- After rolling and tying (step 10), vacuum seal and freeze for up to 18-24 months.
- Thaw in refrigerator for 48 hours before cooking.

**For Freezing (Cooked):**

- Cool completely, slice, and vacuum seal portions.
- Reheat at 180Â°C (350Â°F) for 15-20 minutes (crackling won't be as crisp).

### Storage

- **Frozen (raw rolled, vacuum sealed):** 18-24 months
- **Refrigerated (wet-aging):** 7 days maximum
- **Frozen (cooked):** 12 months
- **Refrigerated (cooked):** 5-7 days

### Pro Tips

**Vacuum Advantage:**

- Wet-aging for 7 days creates collagen breakdown = fall-apart tender meat.
- Herb paste penetrates 2-3cm deep (impossible without vacuum).
- Freeze entire rolled roasts for future feastsâ€”thaw and cook anytime.

**Cooking Tips:**

- **Critical:** Skin must be bone-dry for crackling. Pat multiple times.
- If skin isn't crackling, increase heat to maximum and watch continuously.
- Low and slow roasting is essential for tender meatâ€”don't rush it.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve in crusty Italian rolls with arugula and aioli
- Slice thick and serve with roasted potatoes and fennel
- Dice and add to pasta or risotto
- Cold sliced in sandwiches

**Variations:**

- **Spicy Version:** Double chili flakes and add 2 tbsp harissa to herb paste.
- **Tuscan Version:** Add 2 tbsp sun-dried tomatoes (chopped) to herb paste.
