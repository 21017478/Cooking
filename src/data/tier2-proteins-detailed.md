### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

2. **Mix Ingredients:** Combine beef, onion, garlic, parsley, all spices, baking soda, salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs.
3. **Knead:** Knead vigorously for 3-5 minutes. **Critical:** This releases myosin (protein) for that bouncy, cohesive kofta texture.

**VACUUM SEALING:**

1. **Portioning:**

   - **Option A (Individual):** Form into ovals. Flash freeze for 1 hour on a tray.
   - **Option B (Bulk):** Place bulk mix into bags (1lb portions). Flatten to 1 inch thick.

2. **Sealing:**

   - Vacuum **Normal**.
   - Label: "Kofta Mix, [Date], 2 years".

**STORAGE:**

1. Store flat in freezer.

**COOKING FROM FROZEN/THAWED:**

1. **Thaw:** Fridge overnight or cold water (30 mins).
2. **Cook:** Grill or pan-fry medium-high heat, 4-5 mins per side (160Â°F/71Â°C internal).

### Pro Tips

- **Safety:** Using garlic powder or roasted garlic eliminates botulism risk for raw meat storage.
- **Baking Soda:** The secret to restaurant-style "bouncy" meat texture.

## 🥩 RECIPE T2-006: General Wet-Aged Steaks Guide

**Category:** Beef | **Type:** Protein
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings:** Varies

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 5 minutes
- **Aging Time:** 7-28 days (in fridge)
- **Cook Time:** Varies by steak
- **Total Time:** 5 mins active
- **Storage Duration:** Age then cook or freeze

### Ingredients

- Whole sub-primal cuts (Ribeye roll, Striploin) OR thick-cut individual steaks
- Salt (optional, but unseasoned is safer for long aging to prevent curing texture)

**Optional Additions:**

- Fresh herbs (rosemary/thyme) - *Only for short aging (<1 week)*
- Garlic Powder (Safety: Do NOT use raw garlic cloves in anaerobic aging)

### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- High-quality vacuum bags (thick, multi-layer)
- Refrigerator (must hold steady temp 34-38Â°F / 1-3Â°C)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Select Meat:** Buy high-quality beef. Whole sub-primals work best, but thick individual steaks work too.
2. **Clean:** Pat meat very dry with paper towels. Any surface bacteria should be minimized.

**VACUUM SEALING:**
3. **Bag:** Place meat in bag.
4. **Seal:** Vacuum on maximum setting. You want zero air pockets. Air pockets = spoilage risk. Double seal the ends.

**AGING PROCESS:**
5. **Refrigerate:** Place in the coldest part of your fridge (bottom back).
6. **Wait:**

- **1 week:** Mild tenderness improvement.
- **2 weeks:** Noticeable tenderness, flavor starts to deepen.
- **3-4 weeks:** Maximum tenderness, slight "nutty" aged flavor develops.

7. **Check:** Check bag occasionally. If it puffs up or smells rotten (sulfur/sour) through the bag, discard. A slight confinement odor upon opening is normal but should dissipate in minutes.

**COOKING:**
8. **Trim:** If any surface discoloration occurs, trim it off.
9. **Cook:** Season and cook as normal.

### Storage Instructions

- **Refrigerator:** Up to 28-35 days (if seal is perfect and temp is <38Â°F).
- **Freezer:** After aging, you can freeze for 1-2 years.

### Pro Tips (Vacuum Sealing Advantages)

- **Enzymatic Breakdown:** Natural enzymes break down connective tissue without oxygen, making steak incredibly tender.
- **No Weight Loss:** Unlike dry aging, you lose 0% water weight.
- **Cost:** Buy bulk sub-primals, age them, cut into steaks = 50% cost of butcher aged steaks.

### Variations

- **Koji Aging:** Rub with shio koji before sealing for accelerated aging (3 days = 2 weeks effect).

### Nutrition Information (Per Serving)

- Varies by cut.
