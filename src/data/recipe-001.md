#### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum bags (quart)
- Cast iron skillet (for cooking)
- Sturdy metal spatula
- Parchment paper

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Mix:** Combine beef and spices gently. Do **NOT** overwork the meat (tough burgers).
2. **Portion:** Divide into 8 equal portions (approx 2oz / 60g each).
3. **Shape:** Form into **loose balls**, then gently press into thick "pucks" (hockey puck shape).
   - *Why Pucks?* Balls are hard to vacuum seal (air gaps). Flat patties don't smash well. Pucks are the perfect compromise.

**VACUUM SEALING:**

1. **Flash Freeze:** Place pucks on a parchment-lined tray. Freeze for 1-2 hours until solid.
   - *Critical:* This prevents the vacuum from crushing the loose meat into dense bricks.
2. **Bagging:** Transfer frozen pucks to vacuum bag.
3. **Seal:** Vacuum **Normal**.
   - *Note:* Since they are solid frozen, they won't crush.
4. **Label:** "Smash Pucks, [Date], 2 years".

**STORAGE:**
8. Freeze.

**COOKING FROM FROZEN/THAWED:**
9. **Thaw:** Thaw in fridge overnight.
10. **Cook:**
    - Heat skillet to RIPPING HOT (400°F+).
    - Place puck on skillet.
    - **SMASH** immediately and forcefully with spatula until paper thin.
    - Cook 2 mins (crispy edges), flip, cook 1 min.

#### Chef's Critique & Secrets

- **[CRITICAL COMPONENT] American Cheese:** You *must* specify American Cheese (Boar's Head or Kraft Deli Deluxe). Cheddar breaks and gets oily. Sodium citrate is key.
- **[FLAVOR] "Mustard Fried":** After smashing, squirt yellow mustard onto the raw top side. Flip and sear the mustard into the crust.
- **[SAUCE] Classic Smash Sauce:**  cup Mayo, 2 tbsp Ketchup, 1 tbsp Sweet Pickle Relish, 1 tsp Vinegar, 1 tsp Sugar.
- **[BUN] Potato Bun:** Martin's Potato Rolls. Toast with MAYO, not butter.

### Pro Tips

- **The Smash:** You only get one chance. Smash it raw. Never press it once cooked (you'll squeeze out juice).
- **Crust:** The Maillard reaction requires high heat and dryness. Pat pucks dry if wet from thawing.
