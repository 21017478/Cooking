## 🍄 RECIPE V-001: Balsamic Portobello Steaks

**Category:** Vegetarian | **Type:** Main
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings:** 2-4

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Marination Time:** 15-20 minutes (vacuum)
- **Cook Time:** 10 minutes
- **Total Time:** 40 minutes
- **Storage Duration:** 1 week fridge, 6 months frozen

### Why This Meal is Special

Vacuum sealing Portobello mushrooms transforms their texture entirely. The pressure collapses the air pockets in the fungal structure, forcing the balsamic marinade deep into the "meat." The result is a dense, steak-like texture that is impossible to achieve with standard marination.

### Ingredients

- 4 large Portobello mushrooms, stems removed, wiped clean
- **Marinade:**
  - 60ml (1/4 cup) balsamic vinegar
  - 60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce (or tamari)
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 2 cloves garlic, crushed (Safety: Use 1 tsp powder or roasted garlic paste for long storage)
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp steak seasoning (pepper heavy)

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Balsamic/Soy (Dominant):** Umami Steak Base
- **Smoked Paprika (Supporting):** Meaty depth
- **Garlic/Pepper (Accent):** Savoury punch

### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum bags
- Grill or Cast Iron Skillet

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prep:** Clean mushrooms and remove gills if desired (for cleaner look).
2. **Mix:** Whisk all marinade ingredients.
3. **Bag:** Place mushrooms in bag. Pour marinade over.
4. **Seal:** Use **Pulse** mode. Stop before liquid hits seal bar.
5. **Marinate:** Let sit 15-20 minutes. The vacuum will turn the mushrooms dark and meaty.
6. **Cook:** Grill or sear on high heat, 4-5 minutes per side.

### Pro Tips

- **Meat Substitute:** The vacuum texture makes these incredibly dense and steak-like.
- **Burger Swap:** Perfect size for burger buns.

## 🥗 RECIPE V-002: Asian Marinated Tofu

**Category:** Vegetarian | **Type:** Main
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings:** 4

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 15 minutes
- **Marination Time:** 30 minutes (vacuum)
- **Cook Time:** 15 minutes
- **Total Time:** 1 hour
- **Storage Duration:** 1 week fridge

### Why This Meal is Special

Vacuum sealing is the ultimate hack for tofu. Instead of pressing tofu for hours to remove water, the vacuum pressure forces the marinade *into* the sponge-like structure while keeping it firm. You get flavor in the center of every cube, not just the outside.

### Ingredients

- 2 blocks Extra Firm Tofu, pressed and cubed
- **Marinade:**
  - 1/4 cup soy sauce
  - 2 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
  - 1 tbsp grated ginger
  - 1 tbsp maple syrup
  - 1 tsp chili garlic sauce

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Soy/Sesame (Dominant):** Nutty salty base
- **Ginger/Garlic (Supporting):** Aromatics
- **Maple (Accent):** Sweet balance

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Press:** Press tofu for 15 mins to remove water. Cut into cubes or slabs.
2. **Seal:** Place tofu and marinade in bag. Vacuum seal on **Normal** (tofu is sturdy).
3. **Marinate:** 30 minutes. The marinade will penetrate to the center.
4. **Cook:** Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 20 mins or pan-fry.

### Pro Tips

- **Sponge Effect:** Vacuum sealing tofu works better than any other method because it forces liquid into the porous structure.

## 🥓 RECIPE V-003: Smoky Eggplant "Bacon"

**Category:** Vegetarian | **Type:** Side/Topping
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Servings:** 4

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Marination:** 15 mins
- **Cook Time:** 20-30 mins
- **Storage:** 2 weeks fridge

### Why This Meal is Special

Raw eggplant is like a dry sponge full of air. Vacuum sealing collapses proper cellular structure, infusing it instantly with the smoky cure. When baked, it crisps up rather than turning into mush, mimicking the texture of cured bacon.

### Ingredients

- 1 large eggplant, sliced into thin strips (mandoline best)
- **Marinade:**
  - 3 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tbsp liquid smoke
  - 1 tbsp maple syrup
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper

**Spice Ratios:**

- **Soy/Liquid Smoke (Dominant):** Salty Smoky cure
- **Maple (Supporting):** Candied bacon vibe
- **Paprika (Accent):** Color/Depth

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Slice:** Cut eggplant into bacon-sized strips.
2. **Seal:** Vacuum seal with marinade. The eggplant will collapse and absorb everything.
3. **Cook:** Bake at 300°F (150°C) until crispy (20-30 mins), flipping halfway.

### Pro Tips

- **Texture:** The vacuum collapses the air pockets in eggplant, creating a chewy, meaty texture instead of spongy.
