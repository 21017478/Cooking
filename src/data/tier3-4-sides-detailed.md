## VEGETABLES (6 Recipes)

##  CHEF'S MASTERCLASS: VEGETABLES

*   **[CRITICAL PHYSICS] The 183F Rule:** Vegetables cooked at 140F (steak temp) will *never* tenderize. They must be cooked at 183°F (84°C) or higher to break down pectin.
*   **[GAS RELEASE] Blanch Brassicas:** Broccoli, Cauliflower, and Brussels Sprouts release gas when vacuum cooked. **Mandatory:** Blanch in boiling water for 30 seconds before sealing to stop off-gassing.
*   **[FAT MANAGEMENT] Frozen Butter Pucks:** Freeze pats of butter or oil in an ice cube tray first, then seal the solid fat with the veggies to prevent liquid from sucking into the sealer.

## 🥗 RECIPE T3-001: Blanched Stir-Fry Mix

**Category:** Vegetable | **Type:** Side
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings/Yield:** 4 bags (2 servings each)

### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 2-3 minutes (blanching)
- **Total Time:** 45 minutes (including cooling/drying)
- **Storage Duration:** 12-18 months

### Ingredients

- 500g (1.1 lbs) broccoli florets
- 300g (10.5 oz) carrots, sliced diagonally
- 300g (10.5 oz) bell peppers (red/yellow), sliced
- 200g (7 oz) snap peas or snow peas, trimmed

### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (quart/liter size)
- Large stockpot (for boiling water)
- Large bowl (for ice bath)
- Salad spinner or clean kitchen towels
- Baking sheet (for flash freezing optional)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. Wash all vegetables thoroughly.
2. Cut broccoli into uniform bite-sized florets.
3. Peel and slice carrots into thin diagonal coins (approx 1/8 inch thick).
4. Slice peppers into strips.
5. Trim ends of snap peas.

**COOKING (Blanching):**
6. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 tbsp salt.
7. Prepare a large bowl with ice and cold water.
8. Blanch vegetables in batches (don't crowd the pot):
    - Carrots: 3 minutes
    - Broccoli: 2 minutes
    - Peppers & Snap Peas: 1.5 minutes
9. Immediately transfer boiled vegetables to the ice bath using a slotted spoon.
10. Let sit in ice water for the same amount of time they boiled to stop cooking completely.

**COOLING & DRYING:**
11. Drain vegetables well.
12. **CRITICAL:** Dry thoroughly. Use a salad spinner or lay out on kitchen towels for 15-20 minutes. Excess moisture causes ice crystals.

**VACUUM SEALING:**
13. Mix vegetables together for a colorful blend, or keep separate if preferred.
14. Portion into vacuum bags (approx 300-350g per bag).
15. Arrange in a single flat layer.
16. Vacuum seal using **Normal** setting. If vegetables are delicate, use **Pulse** to avoid crushing.
17. Label: "Stir-Fry Mix, [Date], Best by [Date + 18 months]".

**STORAGE:**
18. Freeze flat. Once frozen, can be stored vertically.

**REHEATING/COOKING:**
19. Do not thaw. Cook directly from frozen.
20. Stir-fry in hot oil for 3-4 minutes until heated through.

### Storage Instructions

- **Freezer:** 12-18 months
- **Refrigerator:** Not recommended (blanched veggies degrade faster in fridge)

### Pro Tips

- **Blanching is Non-Negotiable:** It deactivates enzymes that cause flavor/color loss and spoilage.
- **Dryness = Quality:** The drier the veggies before sealing, the less frost you'll see in the bag.
- **Portion Control:** Pack in amounts you will actually use for one meal.

**COOKING (Blanching):**
3. Boil salted water.
4. Add beans in batches.
5. Blanch for exactly 3 minutes (beans should be bright green and crisp-tender).
6. Plunge immediately into ice bath for 3 minutes.

**COOLING & DRYING:**
7. Drain well.
8. Spread on towels and pat dry. Ensure no water droplets remain.

**VACUUM SEALING:**
9. Portion into bags (approx 250g per bag).
10. Arrange beans parallel to each other for a neat, flat pack.
11. Vacuum seal on **Normal** setting.
12. Label: "Green Beans, [Date], 18 months".

- 1/2 tsp black pepper

**Spice Ratios:**

### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer

**COOKING (Par-boil):**
3. Place wedges in boiling water for 3-4 minutes. They should be slightly softened on the outside but raw in the middle.

- Vacuum bags
- Large pot
- Colander

### Step-by-Step Instructions
