# Recipe Optimization Changelog

Tracking scientific refinements applied to recipes during Phase 2.

## Tier 1: User Favorites

### 🍔 Smash Burgers (smash-burgers-001)

- **Optimization:** Oxidation Prevention & Fat Stability.
- **Change:** Added specific instruction to freeze patties *immediately* after forming to prevent fat oxidation.
- **Science:** Beef fat oxidizes rapidly when exposed to air (rancidity). Vacuum sealing halts this, preserving the "fresh ground" taste for months.

### 🥙 Doner Kebab (doner-kebab-001)

- **Optimization:** Myosin Extraction (Texture).
- **Change:** Added "Compression Rest" step. Seal meat tightly and refrigerate 24h before cooking.
- **Science:** Vacuum pressure + salt extracts myosin protein, which acts as a natural glue. This creates the authentic, dense "loaf" texture of shop-bought doner.

### 🍢 Chicken Kofte (chicken-kofte-001)

- **Optimization:** pH Manipulation (Tenderness).
- **Change:** Added optional baking soda (0.5%) to ingredients.
- **Science:** Slight alkalinity prevents protein fibers from contracting too tightly during cooking, ensuring juicy kofte even after freezing.

## Premium Meals (Batch 1)

### 🥩 Wet-Aged Ribeye (pm-001)

- **Optimization:** Enzymatic Activity Zone.
- **Change:** Added strict temperature guidelines (34-38°F).
- **Science:** Calpain enzymes are most active at this range. Freezing stops them; heating kills them. The vacuum environment prevents aerobic spoilage while these enzymes tenderize the meat.

### 🥩 Wet-Aged Sirloin (pm-002)

- **Optimization:** Collagen Hydrolysis.
- **Change:** Specified 14-day duration for leaner cuts.
- **Science:** Sirloin has tighter muscle fibers than ribeye. The vacuum aging process breaks down the collagen sheaths around these fibers, mimicking the tenderness of a filet mignon.

### 🥙 Chicken Shawarma (pm-003)

- **Optimization:** Hyper-Absorption.
- **Change:** Highlighted the 45-minute vacuum marination vs 24-hour traditional soak.
- **Science:** The negative pressure expands the meat's cellular structure, allowing the thick yogurt marinade to penetrate instantly rather than sitting on the surface.

### 🥢 Korean Bulgogi (pm-004)

- **Optimization:** Enzymatic Acceleration.
- **Change:** Emphasized the interaction between pear enzymes and vacuum pressure.
- **Science:** Asian pear contains calpain-like enzymes. Vacuum sealing forces these directly into the protein structure, tenderizing the beef in minutes instead of hours.

## Premium Meals (Batch 2)

### 🍖 Mediterranean Lamb Chops (pm-005)

- **Optimization:** Lipid Solubility.
- **Change:** Emphasized the role of oil in flavor transfer.
- **Science:** Aromatic compounds in rosemary and garlic are hydrophobic (oil-soluble). The vacuum environment forces this infused oil into the meat's surface pores more effectively than air-pressure marination.

### 🐟 Miso-Ginger Salmon (pm-006)

- **Optimization:** Osmotic Glazing.
- **Change:** Added note on texture firming.
- **Science:** The high salt/sugar content of miso creates osmotic pressure, drawing surface moisture out while the vacuum pushes flavor in. This creates a "cured" texture that holds up better to cooking.

### 🍗 Tandoori Chicken (pm-007)

- **Optimization:** Lactic Acid Activation.
- **Change:** Highlighted yogurt's dual role.
- **Science:** Lactic acid breaks down protein fibers, while calcium in yogurt activates the meat's natural calpain enzymes. Vacuum sealing accelerates this interaction significantly.

### 🌮 Carne Asada Tacos (pm-008)

- **Optimization:** Controlled Denaturation.
- **Change:** Added strict time limit warning (25 mins).
- **Science:** Highly acidic citrus marinades can "cook" meat (denaturation) leading to a chalky texture. Vacuum sealing intensifies this, so the time must be strictly limited to the "sweet spot."

## Premium Meals (Batch 3)

### 🍛 Butter Chicken (pm-009)

- **Optimization:** Cryo-Blooming.
- **Change:** Added note on flavor improvement over time.
- **Science:** Spices (especially fenugreek and garam masala) continue to release volatile oils into the fat (cream/butter) even at freezing temperatures, leading to a more complex flavor profile after 2 weeks.

### 🍝 Beef Ragu (pm-010)

- **Optimization:** Collagen Gelatinization.
- **Change:** Explained the "setting" process.
- **Science:** The long cook breaks collagen into gelatin. Vacuum sealing while warm (but not hot) and cooling rapidly sets this gelatin matrix, trapping moisture and flavor more effectively than loose storage.

### 🥓 Herb-Crusted Pork (pm-011)

- **Optimization:** Hydration Adhesion.
- **Change:** Removed need for binders.
- **Science:** The vacuum process draws moisture to the surface of the meat, hydrating dried herbs and causing them to adhere perfectly without the need for egg wash or oil binders.

### 🦐 Garlic Butter Shrimp (pm-012)

- **Optimization:** Lipid Protection (Butter Buffer).
- **Change:** Emphasized butter coating.
- **Science:** Shrimp are extremely prone to freezer burn (sublimation). Coating them in a solid fat (butter) before sealing creates a secondary barrier that guarantees 100% texture preservation.
