# 📱 How to Create Your APK (PWA Builder Method)

I have prepared a **deployment-ready zip file** for you: `vacuum-app-deploy-ready.zip`.

## Step 1: Deploy to the Web (Free & Fast)

You need a public URL for PWA Builder to work.

1. Go to **[Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)** (no account needed for quick test, free account recommended for permanent).
2. Drag and drop the `vacuum-app-deploy-ready.zip` file (or the unzipped folder) onto the page.
3. Wait a few seconds. Netlify will give you a URL (e.g., `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`).
4. **Copy this URL.**

## Step 2: Generate APK

1. Go to **[PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)**.
2. Paste your Netlify URL into the box.
3. Click **Start**.
4. You should see a high score (Manifest, Service Worker, Security checks passed).
5. Click **Package for Stores**.
6. Select **Android**.
7. Download the **APK** file.

## Step 3: Install

1. Transfer the APK to your Android phone.
2. Tap to install.
3. Enjoy your app!
