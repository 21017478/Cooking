#### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Marination Time:** 0 minutes (season and seal)
- **Cook Time:** 4-5 minutes (when ready to cook)
- **Total Time:** 10 minutes prep
- **Storage Duration:** 2-3 years frozen

#### Ingredients

**Main:**

- 500g (1 lb) ground beef, 80/20 lean-to-fat ratio
- 5g (1 tsp) fine sea salt
- 2g (½ tsp) freshly ground black pepper
- 3g (½ tsp) garlic powder
- 3g (½ tsp) onion powder
- 2g (¼ tsp) smoked paprika (optional, for depth)

**Optional Additions (per burger when cooking):**

- 1 slice American cheese
- Burger buns
- Pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato
- Condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo)

#### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (quart or gallon size)
- Large mixing bowl
- Kitchen scale (for portioning)
- Parchment paper (for layering)
- Permanent marker (for labeling)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Prepare Work Surface**
   - Clear a clean work area
   - Have vacuum bags ready
   - Cut parchment paper into 4" x 4" squares (8 pieces)

2. **Mix Seasonings**
   - In a large bowl, combine ground beef with all seasonings
   - Mix gently with hands for 30-60 seconds
   - Do NOT overmix - this makes burgers tough
   - The meat should look evenly seasoned but still loose

3. **Portion the Meat**
   - Divide seasoned beef into 8 equal portions (62.5g / 2.2 oz each)
   - Gently form each portion into a loose ball
   - Do NOT compress - keep them loose for better texture

4. **Shape for Vacuum Sealing**
   - Place each ball on parchment paper
   - Gently flatten to about ½" thick rounds (3-4" diameter)
   - Keep edges loose and irregular
   - The vacuum will compress them slightly

**VACUUM SEALING:**

5. **Layer the Patties**
   - Place first patty in vacuum bag
   - Add parchment square on top
   - Add second patty
   - Repeat layering (parchment between each patty)
   - You can seal 2-4 patties per bag depending on bag size

6. **Seal the Bags**
   - Place bag in vacuum sealer
   - Use GENTLE or DELICATE setting if available (prevents over-compression)
   - Seal the bag
   - The patties will flatten slightly - this is normal
   - Check seal is complete

7. **Label and Store**
   - Write on bag with permanent marker:
     - "Smash Burger Patties"
     - Number of patties
     - Date sealed
     - "Best by: [2-3 years from date]"
   - Place flat in freezer
   - Stack for space efficiency

**COOKING FROM FROZEN:**

8. **Thawing (Optional)**
   - Option 1: Thaw in fridge overnight (recommended)
   - Option 2: Cook from frozen (add 1-2 minutes to cook time)
   - Option 3: Quick thaw in cold water (sealed bag) for 20 minutes

9. **Cook the Smash Burgers**
   - Heat cast iron skillet or griddle to HIGH heat (400-450°F)
   - Lightly oil the surface
   - Place burger ball on hot surface
   - IMMEDIATELY smash hard with sturdy spatula for 3-5 seconds
   - Press until 1/4" thin - you want maximum contact
   - Cook 2 minutes until deep brown crust forms
   - Flip, add cheese, cook 1-2 minutes more
   - Internal temp should reach 160°F (71°C)

10. **Serve**
    - Place on toasted bun
    - Add toppings as desired
    - Serve immediately while crust is crispy

#### Storage Instructions

**Vacuum Sealed:**

- **Freezer:** 2-3 years (prevents freezer burn completely)
- **Refrigerator:** 7-10 days (if planning to use soon)

**After Opening:**

- Cook within 24 hours if thawed in fridge
- Do not refreeze raw meat after thawing

#### Pro Tips (Vacuum Sealing Advantages)

🔥 **Why Vacuum Sealing Makes These Better:**

- Zero freezer burn = beef tastes fresh even after 2 years
- Pre-seasoning means flavors have time to penetrate
- Flat packing = faster thawing (30 min vs 2+ hours)
- Portion control = grab exactly what you need
- Space efficient = stack 20+ burgers in minimal freezer space

**Smash Burger Secrets:**

- Cold meat smashes better - cook from fridge-cold or half-frozen
- High heat is essential for the Maillard crust
- Only smash once - never press again or juices escape
- Use a sturdy spatula - cheap ones won't apply enough pressure
- The thinner you smash, the better the crust-to-meat ratio

**Seasoning Science:**

- Salt breaks down proteins slightly, helping burgers hold together
- Garlic and onion powders > fresh for vacuum sealing (no moisture, no botulism risk)
- Smoked paprika adds umami depth without overpowering beef flavor

#### Variations

**Steakhouse Burger:**

- Add 2g (½ tsp) MSG or beef bouillon powder
- Add 1g (¼ tsp) dried thyme

**Spicy Southwest:**

- Add 3g (½ tsp) chipotle powder
- Add 2g (¼ tsp) cumin
- Add pinch cayenne

**Umami Bomb:**

- Add 3g (½ tsp) mushroom powder
- Add 2g (¼ tsp) soy sauce powder
- Add 1g (¼ tsp) dried rosemary

**Budget Triple-Batch:**

- Scale up to 1.5kg (3 lbs) beef = 24 patties
- Seal in bags of 4 patties
- Perfect for meal prep

#### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (quart size)
- Sharp knife and cutting board
- Large mixing bowl
- Whisk
- Grill, grill pan, or cast iron skillet
- Tongs
- Meat thermometer

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Prepare the Chicken**
   - Pat chicken thighs completely dry with paper towels
   - Place on cutting board
   - Slice against the grain into thin strips (¼" thick)
   - Aim for uniform thickness for even cooking
   - Each strip should be 2-3" long and ½-1" wide

2. **Make the Marinade**
   - In large bowl, combine Greek yogurt and olive oil
   - Whisk until smooth and emulsified
   - Add lemon juice and whisk again
   - Add all spices (paprika, cumin, oregano, coriander, pepper, salt, cayenne, cinnamon)
   - Add minced garlic
   - Whisk until completely combined
   - Taste marinade - it should be punchy and well-seasoned

3. **Marinate the Chicken**
   - Add sliced chicken to marinade
   - Mix with hands, ensuring every piece is coated
   - The yogurt should cling to all surfaces
   - Massage marinade into chicken for 30 seconds

**VACUUM SEALING:**

4. **Seal for Flash Marination (cook within hours)**
   - Transfer chicken and marinade to vacuum bag
   - Spread chicken in single layer if possible
   - Leave 3" space at top of bag
   - Use PULSE function to prevent liquid being sucked out
   - Pulse 3-4 times, then seal when air is mostly removed
   - Alternatively: Elevate sealer, let bag hang down to keep liquid away from seal

5. **Flash Marinate**
   - Once sealed, massage bag gently to distribute marinade
   - Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes
   - The vacuum pressure forces marinade deep into chicken
   - OR refrigerate for up to 2 hours for even deeper flavor

**ALTERNATIVE - Seal for Long-Term Storage:**

6. **Freeze for Later**
   - After sealing in Step 4, immediately flatten bag
   - Place flat in freezer
   - The vacuum-sealed chicken will marinate while frozen
   - Flavors continue to penetrate during frozen storage
   - Will be perfectly marinated when thawed

**COOKING:**

7. **Prepare to Cook**
   - If frozen: Thaw in fridge overnight or in cold water for 45 minutes
   - If fresh-marinated: Remove from fridge 10 minutes before cooking
   - Open bag and remove chicken (discard excess marinade or save for basting)

8. **Cook the Doner**

   **OPTION A - Grill (most authentic):**
   - Preheat grill to HIGH (450-500°F)
   - Thread chicken strips onto skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak first)
   - OR lay strips directly on grill grates
   - Grill 3-4 minutes per side until charred
   - Internal temp: 165°F (74°C)

   **OPTION B - Grill Pan/Skillet (easier):**
   - Heat cast iron skillet or grill pan to MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Add thin layer of oil
   - Working in batches, lay chicken strips flat
   - DO NOT overcrowd - leave space between pieces
   - Cook 3-4 minutes per side until deeply browned
   - Internal temp: 165°F (74°C)

   **OPTION C - Oven Broil:**
   - Preheat broiler to HIGH
   - Arrange chicken on foil-lined baking sheet
   - Position 4-6" from broiler element
   - Broil 4-5 minutes per side
   - Watch carefully to prevent burning

9. **Rest and Slice**
   - Let chicken rest 2-3 minutes
   - If pieces are large, slice into smaller strips
   - Keep warm

**ASSEMBLY:**

10. **Build the Doner**
    - Warm pita or flatbread
    - Layer chicken down the center
    - Add shredded lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion
    - Drizzle generously with tzatziki or garlic sauce
    - Add hot sauce if desired
    - Wrap tightly and serve immediately

#### Storage Instructions

**Vacuum Sealed (Marinated, Raw):**

   - Add breadcrumbs
   - Add egg
   - Add olive oil
   - Add feta if using

3. **Mix Thoroughly**
   - Using hands (best) or wooden spoon, mix for 2-3 minutes
   - The mixture should become slightly sticky and cohesive
   - This develops the myosin (meat protein) which helps koftas hold together
   - Mixture should be well combined and uniform
   - Should be soft but shapeable

4. **Test Seasoning (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Form small patty from mixture
   - Cook in skillet 2-3 minutes per side
   - Taste and adjust seasoning if needed
   - Slightly over-season - flavors mellow when frozen

**SHAPING:**

5. **Shape the Koftas**

   **OPTION A - Skewer Style (Traditional):**
   - Wet hands with water
   - Take golf-ball sized portion (40-50g)
   - Form into sausage shape around skewer (6" long, 1" thick)
   - Compress firmly so it holds to skewer

   - They'll hold shape better during sealing

**VACUUM SEALING:**

7. **Prepare for Sealing**
   - Cut parchment paper into squares (4" x 4")
   - Remove koftas from fridge

8. **Layer in Vacuum Bags**
   - Place 4-5 koftas in one vacuum bag
   - Put parchment paper between each layer
   - Arrange in single layer if possible
   - Leave 3" at top of bag for sealing

9. **Gentle Vacuum Seal**
   - Use GENTLE or DELICATE setting if available
   - If no gentle setting, use PULSE mode
   - You want to remove air WITHOUT crushing the koftas
   - Pulse several times until air is mostly out
   - Seal the bag
   - The koftas may compress slightly - this is acceptable

10. **Label and Freeze**
    - Write on bag:
      - "Chicken Kofte"
      - "16-20 pieces"
      - Date sealed

## PREMIUM MEAL 003: 30-Minute Marinated Chicken Shawarma Feast

**Complete Meal Components:** Main + 2 Sides + Bread  
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Servings:** 4 servings

#### Time Requirements
- **Total Prep Time:** 35 minutes (all components)
- **Marination Time:** 30 minutes vacuum (vs 8-12 hours traditional)
- **Cook Time:** 12-15 minutes
- **Total Time:** 80 minutes start to finish
- **Storage Duration:** Marinated chicken: 1-2 years frozen, Pickles: 2-3 months refrigerated

#### Why This Meal is Special

**The 30-Minute Marination Revolution:**
Traditional shawarma requires 8-12 hours of marination for the thick yogurt-spice paste to penetrate chicken. Vacuum sealing compresses this to just 30 minutes through pressure differential physics. The vacuum opens chicken fibers, then atmospheric pressure forces the marinade deep inside when sealed. This is physically impossible to achieve quickly without vacuum sealing.
