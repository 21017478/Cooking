## CATEGORY 1: WET-AGED STEAKS

*Leveraging vacuum sealing's wet aging capability*

### 🥩 MEAL 1: 21-Day Wet-Aged Ribeye with Garlic Herb Crust

**Why Vacuum Sealing Makes It Special:**
Wet aging in vacuum-sealed bags allows natural enzymes to break down muscle fibers over 2-3 weeks, creating restaurant-quality tenderness and concentrated flavor that's impossible to achieve with standard storage.

**Components:**

1. **Main: 21-Day Wet-Aged Ribeye**
   - Vacuum seal fresh ribeye steak
   - Refrigerate for 21 days (turn every 3-4 days)
   - Enzymes tenderize, flavor intensifies
   - Result: Butter-tender, rich beef flavor

2. **Topping: Garlic Herb Compound Butter**
   - Mix softened butter with roasted garlic, thyme, rosemary, parsley
   - Vacuum seal in log form
   - Slice a medallion to melt over hot steak

3. **Side: Blanched Asparagus with Lemon**
   - Blanch asparagus, ice bath, dry thoroughly
   - Vacuum seal with lemon zest and black pepper
