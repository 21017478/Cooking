## 🧐 "HOW CAN IT BE SO CHEAP?" (The Truth)

**1. The Technology is Simple:**
A vacuum sealer is just a small air pump and a heating wire. It's not a computer. The technology hasn't changed in 20 years.
* **Expensive models** use the *exact same* pump mechanism but add stainless steel casing and brand marketing.
* **Budget models** use plastic casing but the same core motor.

**2. You Pay for "Duty Cycle":**
* **£100 FoodSaver:** Can seal 50 bags in a row without overheating. (Great for hunters/farmers).
* **£19 AliExpress:** Needs a 20-second break after every 5-10 bags. (Perfect for home cooks).

**3. No Middleman:**
* Buying from AliExpress cuts out the UK retailer markup. That £19 machine would cost £45 if it had a "Salter" or "Tower" logo on it in Argos.

## 🎒 BAGS & ROLLS 101: Everything You Need to Know

### **1. Why "Textured" Bags are REQUIRED**

- **The Problem:** Smooth bags (like Ziplocs) trap air because the plastic sticks together.
* **The Solution:** Textured bags have tiny bumps that create "air tunnels" so the machine can suck the air out.
* **Rule:** If it doesn't have bumps, it won't work.

### **2. Rolls vs. Pre-Cut Bags (The Math)**

- **Pre-Cut Bags:** Convenient but expensive (~£0.20 per bag).
* **Rolls:** You cut exactly what you need.
  * *Example:* Sealing a single sausage? Cut a 10cm strip.
  * *Example:* Sealing a whole rack of ribs? Cut a 40cm strip.
  * **Savings:** Rolls are ~30-50% cheaper per meter than pre-cut bags.

### **3. Can You Reuse Them?**

- **Dry Goods (Rice/Beans):** ✅ YES. Wash and reuse.
* **Vegetables:** ✅ YES. Wash and reuse.
* **Raw Meat/Fish:** ❌ **NO.** Even with washing, bacteria (Salmonella) can hide in the textured channels. It is not worth the risk. Throw these away.

## 🔍 GADGET CHECK: The "Mini Heat Sealer" (£1.30)

**Verdict: REDUNDANT (You don't need it).**

1. **For Opening:** The **AliExpress UV Sealer** has a **built-in sliding cutter**. It slices bags open cleanly in 1 second.
2. **For Closing:** The main machine has a **"Seal Only" button**. It creates a wide, strong, leak-proof seal. The mini tool creates a thin, weak seal that often leaks.
3. **Warning:** Never just "reseal" a meat bag without vacuuming. You trap bacteria inside. Always re-vacuum.

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR MARINATING

1. **The "Freeze-First" Trick (Best for Liquids):**
    * Put meat + marinade in the bag.
    * Freeze for 2-3 hours until the liquid is slushy.
    * Vacuum seal it.
    * **Result:** 100% perfect seal, zero liquid sucked into the machine.

2. **The "Pulse/Stop" Method:**
    * Put meat + marinade in.
    * Press "Vacuum" (or Pulse).
    * Watch the liquid climb up the bag.
    * **Press "Stop" or "Seal"** *just* before it hits the machine.
