### 🥩 RECIPE T2-001: Turkish Kofta Mix (Beef)

**Category:** Beef | **Type:** Protein
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings:** 4-6 servings (16-20 koftas)

#### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
- **Marination Time:** N/A (flavors meld in storage)
- **Cook Time:** 10-12 minutes
- **Total Time:** 30 minutes active
- **Storage Duration:** 2-3 years frozen

#### Ingredients

- 1 kg (2.2 lbs) ground beef (80/20 or 85/15)
- 1 large onion, grated and squeezed dry (approx. 150g / 5 oz)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 30g (½ cup) fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 10g (2 tsp) ground cumin
- 10g (2 tsp) ground coriander
- 10g (2 tsp) paprika (sweet or smoked)
- 2g (½ tsp) baking soda (helps texture)
- 10g (2 tsp) salt
- 5g (1 tsp) black pepper
- 30g (¼ cup) breadcrumbs (optional binder)

**Optional Additions:**

- 1 tsp red pepper flakes for heat
- 1 tsp sumac for tanginess

#### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- Vacuum sealer bags (quart/liter size)
- Large mixing bowl
- Grater (for onion)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Prepare Aromatics:** Grate the onion and squeeze out excess moisture using a paper towel or cheesecloth. This prevents the mixture from becoming too wet. Finely chop the parsley and mince the garlic.
2. **Mix Ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, prepared onion, garlic, parsley, cumin, coriander, paprika, baking soda, salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs (if using).
3. **Knead the Meat:** Knead the mixture vigorously with your hands for 3-5 minutes. This is crucial! It releases proteins (myosin) that help the koftas hold their shape and gives them that characteristic springy texture.

**VACUUM SEALING:**
4. **Portioning:**

- **Option A (Ready-to-Cook):** Form mixture into oval shapes (koftas) or patties. Place on a parchment-lined tray and freeze for 1-2 hours until solid (flash freezing). Then transfer to vacuum bags.
- **Option B (Bulk Mix):** Divide the bulk mixture into meal-sized portions (e.g., 500g/1 lb bags). Flatten the bags for easy storage and quick thawing.

5. **Sealing:**
   - Place portions in vacuum bags.
   - If flash-frozen (Option A), seal normally.
   - If bulk mix (Option B), flatten the bag to about 1-inch thickness.
   - Vacuum and seal.
   - Label with date and recipe name.

**STORAGE:**
6. Store flat in the freezer.

**COOKING FROM FROZEN/THAWED:**
7. **Thawing:** Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. If in a flat pack, it will thaw quickly (in cold water in ~30 mins).
8. **Cooking:**

- **Grill/Pan:** Cook on medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes per side until browned and cooked through (Internal temp 160°F/71°C).
- **Oven:** Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes.

#### Storage Instructions

- **Freezer:** 2-3 years
- **Refrigerator:** 24 hours after thawing
- **After Opening:** Cook immediately

#### Pro Tips (Vacuum Sealing Advantages)

- **Flavor Infusion:** The spices penetrate the meat deeply during storage, resulting in a more flavorful kofta than fresh.
- **Texture:** The vacuum compression helps the meat bind, improving the texture.
- **Convenience:** Having pre-seasoned meat ready to shape or cook saves massive prep time on weeknights.

#### Variations

- **Spicy Kofta:** Add 1 tbsp harissa paste or more chili flakes.
- **Herbed Kofta:** Add fresh mint and dill along with parsley.

### 🥩 RECIPE T2-006: General Wet-Aged Steaks Guide

**Category:** Beef | **Type:** Protein
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Servings:** Varies

#### Time Requirements

- **Prep Time:** 5 minutes
- **Aging Time:** 7-28 days (in fridge)
- **Cook Time:** Varies by steak
- **Total Time:** 5 mins active
- **Storage Duration:** Age then cook or freeze

#### Ingredients

- Whole sub-primal cuts (Ribeye roll, Striploin) OR thick-cut individual steaks
- Salt (optional, but unseasoned is safer for long aging to prevent curing texture)

**Optional Additions:**

- Fresh herbs (rosemary/thyme) - *Only for short aging (<1 week)*

#### Equipment Needed

- Vacuum sealer
- High-quality vacuum bags (thick, multi-layer)
- Refrigerator (must hold steady temp 34-38°F / 1-3°C)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**PREPARATION:**

1. **Select Meat:** Buy high-quality beef. Whole sub-primals work best, but thick individual steaks work too.
2. **Clean:** Pat meat very dry with paper towels. Any surface bacteria should be minimized.

**VACUUM SEALING:**
3. **Bag:** Place meat in bag.
4. **Seal:** Vacuum on maximum setting. You want zero air pockets. Air pockets = spoilage risk. Double seal the ends.

**AGING PROCESS:**
5. **Refrigerate:** Place in the coldest part of your fridge (bottom back).
6. **Wait:**

- **1 week:** Mild tenderness improvement.
- **2 weeks:** Noticeable tenderness, flavor starts to deepen.
- **3-4 weeks:** Maximum tenderness, slight "nutty" aged flavor develops.

7. **Check:** Check bag occasionally. If it puffs up or smells rotten (sulfur/sour) through the bag, discard. A slight confinement odor upon opening is normal but should dissipate in minutes.

**COOKING:**
8. **Trim:** If any surface discoloration occurs, trim it off.
9. **Cook:** Season and cook as normal.

#### Storage Instructions

- **Refrigerator:** Up to 28-35 days (if seal is perfect and temp is <38°F).
- **Freezer:** After aging, you can freeze for 1-2 years.

#### Pro Tips (Vacuum Sealing Advantages)

- **Enzymatic Breakdown:** Natural enzymes break down connective tissue without oxygen, making steak incredibly tender.
- **No Weight Loss:** Unlike dry aging, you lose 0% water weight.
- **Cost:** Buy bulk sub-primals, age them, cut into steaks = 50% cost of butcher aged steaks.

#### Variations

- **Koji Aging:** Rub with shio koji before sealing for accelerated aging (3 days = 2 weeks effect).

#### Nutrition Information (Per Serving)

- Varies by cut.
